# Welcome to this Project Computer Programming!
We are currently doing something awesome. So please be patient!

# Please read! How to do work in GitHub
Step 1 : Make a branch for yourself (or use other developer's branch) by using the latest master branch as your initial branch branching.

Step 2 : Make a change (NOT IN MASTER! Read below on why)

Step 3 : Create Pull requests from your branch to master : 
https://github.com/sagelga/Project-Computer-Programming/compare

Step 4 : Merging with master requires file to be compilable! Broken file will not be allowed into master (Read below for more info)

Step 5 : YAY! Product is now served!

# Master branch push rules
1) Travis CLI will check that the file is able to compile (using GCC) or not

Compiling failed will denied your merge requests! 
Check the status here : https://travis-ci.org/sagelga/Project-Computer-Programming/branches

2) You cannot do push to master branch. Every PUSH requests will be denied and failed. Please go and fix your problem, and try again.

3) It may takes some period of time to compile the file. Please be very patient about that!

# Locked Items
Master branch and developement branch is blocking you from deleting it. 
Please contact me to delete something. This is destructive actions!
